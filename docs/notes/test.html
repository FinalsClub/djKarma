  Again this year there are several changes that affect us. The most notable is the weekend. Beginning last year, Fest is now being held on the third weekend in August.

  <FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">As I am sure you are aware, the festival has been the main fund raising event for the Philadelphia Folk Song Society. However, many of the recent years have not been financial successes. With reduced resources the Society has had to suspend grant programs, reduce educational programs, make venue changes, and programming adjustments. In fact, profitability has declined to the point where the future of the festival may be in jeopardy. The services provided for volunteers (water, port-a pots, food, etc.) are a significant expense. In order to improve profitability, and help insure the future of the festival, the society has decided to institute a volunteer fee. Adult volunteers, those 18 years of age and older will pay $20. Those volunteers who are 12 to 17 years of age will pay $10. A great value considering you will be able to enjoy over 65+ hours of music plus dancing, crafts, children’s activities, meals, snacks, and camping. All Festival with Camping tickets will be sold for $160 in 2007.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

We will be open for business from 11:00 AM until after the end of the evening concert on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

  <FONT SIZE=2>Wikee Wakee Woo – which translated means: Society Sales Volunteer Party!!!</FONT>
</H1>
<P CLASS=western>
  <FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The party the past years has been such a hit that we plan to have another this year: Thursday, August 16<SUP>th</SUP> starting around 6 pm at the tent. The theme of this party is a Hawaiian Luau (again. since we already have the decorations). So unpack those Hawaiian shirts and plan to get wikee wakee with the rest of the woo, I mean crew! All members of the committee (sales, Cd’s, Camping Ice) are encouraged to attend. <I>We will provide some food, but please plan to bring some food, snacks, and/or beverages to share.</I> There will also be prizes and an open mic - you will not want to miss this! We also ask that everyone who attends the party please donate $3 per person ($9 max per family) to cover the food cost. Again, we'd like to lessen the financial burden on the Festival and fend for ourselves. I will collect the money during pre-fest workdays.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>
