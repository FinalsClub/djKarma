          <div class="content">
            <p>Last updated: April 13, 2012</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services, websites, and applications offered by KarmaNotes (the "Service"). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h4>Use of the Service</h4>
            <p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with KarmaNotes, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. You must provide us accurate information when you create your account on KarmaNotes. We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. KarmaNotes will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these requirements.</p>

            <h4>User Content</h4>
            <p>"Content" means any information, text, graphics, or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Service. The original copyright holder retains all rights to any content that you (the user) submit, post, display, or otherwise make available on the Service.</p>

            <h4>Your License to KarmaNotes</h4>
            <p>By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Service, you grant KarmaNotes permission to share all content under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license. For more information, see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/</a>  If you would like more information, please contact us directly.</p>

            <p>You agree that this license includes the right for other users of the Service to modify your Content, and for KarmaNotes to make your Content available to others for the publication, distribution, syndication, or broadcast of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by KarmaNotes or others may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service. We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p>



            <h4>KarmaNotes's Licenses to You</h4>
            <p>Subject to these Terms, KarmaNotes gives you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to re-post any of the Content on KarmaNotes anywhere on the rest of the web provided that the Content was added to the Service after June 22, 2011, and provided that the user who created the content has not explicitly marked the content as not for reproduction, and provided that you: (a) do not modify the Content; (b) attribute KarmaNotes with a human and machine-followable link (an A tag) linking back to the page displaying the original source of the content on KarmaNotes.org (c) upon request, either by KarmaNotes or a user, remove the user's name from Content which the user has subsequently made anonymous; (d) upon request, either by KarmaNotes or by a user who contributed to the Content, make a reasonable effort to update a particular piece of Content to the latest version on KarmaNotes.org; and (e) upon request, either by KarmaNotes or by a user who contributed to the Content, make a reasonable attempt to delete Content that has been deleted on KarmaNotes.org. Your Content will be viewable by other users of the Service and through third party services and websites.

            <h4>General Terms</h4>
            <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. Unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph, all claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Service will be brought solely in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between KarmaNotes and you regarding the Service (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with KarmaNotes that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between KarmaNotes and you regarding the Service. The failure of KarmaNotes to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be on this page (or such other page as the Service may indicate). If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via posting to our website or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
